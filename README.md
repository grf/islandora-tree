# islandora-tree
ruby/sparql code to construct an adjacency graph of islandora objects 

The idea is to list all of the Islandora objects and their interesting properties: parents, models and state (active, deleted, inactive) and build an adjacency data structure which describes the islandora opbject hierarchy.
